*John Doe* responded to your event:

🎯 Event: Family Dinner
👤 Response: ✅ Going
📆 Date: Oct 20, 2025 at 06:00 PM

_Family Calendar_
```

**Setup Steps**:
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251017_add_rsvp_whatsapp_notification.sql`
3. That's it! Notifications will now be sent automatically

### 3. AI Event Assistant 🤖✨
**Status**: 🔧 Needs setup (OpenAI API Key required)

The AI assistant can:
- Suggest event titles and descriptions based on your calendar history
- Recommend optimal times for events based on patterns
- Send daily smart reminders (e.g., "You usually shop Sunday afternoon - want to schedule grocery shopping?")

**Setup Steps**:

#### A. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

#### B. Add API Key to Supabase
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click "Project Settings" → "Edge Functions" → "Secrets"
3. Add a new secret:
   - Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your OpenAI API key

#### C. Deploy Edge Functions
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Deploy AI Event Assistant
npx supabase functions deploy ai-event-assistant

# Deploy Smart Reminders
npx supabase functions deploy send-smart-reminders
```

#### D. Update Scheduled Reminders (Optional)
If you want daily AI reminders at 9 AM:
1. Edit `supabase/migrations/20251017_schedule_ai_reminders.sql`
2. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` with your Supabase project reference (from your project URL)
3. Replace `YOUR_ANON_KEY` with your Supabase anon key
4. Run the migration in SQL Editor

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### AI Suggestions Not Working?
- Check that OpenAI API key is added to Supabase secrets
- Verify Edge Functions are deployed
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you have at least 2-3 events in your calendar for pattern analysis

### RSVP Notifications Not Sending?
- Verify the migration was applied successfully
- Check that profiles have phone numbers in the correct format
- Look in the `reminder_queue` table to see if messages are queued
- Check the WhatsApp reminder cron job is running

### AI Giving Generic Suggestions?
- Add more events to your calendar (AI learns from patterns)
- Events need to repeat at least 2 times to be recognized as patterns
- Make sure event titles are descriptive

## 📊 Database Tables Used

- `events` - Calendar events
- `profiles` - User profiles with avatars and names
- `event_invites` - RSVP responses
- `reminder_queue` - WhatsApp messages to send
- `families` - Family groups
- `family_members` - Family membership

## 🔐 Security Notes

- All database operations use Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only see/edit their own data
- AI assistant only analyzes the requesting user's events
- OpenAI API key is stored securely in Supabase secrets
- WhatsApp messages only go to users in the same family

2. Set up OpenAI API key (if you want AI features)
3. Deploy Edge Functions
