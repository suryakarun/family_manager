## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Go to your **Supabase SQL Editor** and run the file:
```
supabase/migrations/20251017_add_event_photos.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ `event-photos` storage bucket (supports images & videos up to 50MB)
- ✅ `event_photos` table (stores photo metadata)
- ✅ `photo_reactions` table (stores emoji reactions)
- ✅ RLS policies (family members can view/upload)
- ✅ WhatsApp notification trigger

### Step 2: Refresh Your App

Once migration is applied:
1. Refresh your browser: http://localhost:8080
2. Open any **existing event**  
3. You'll see **two tabs**: "RSVP" and "Photos"
4. Click the **"Photos"** tab 📸

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Photos tab not showing"
- Only shows for **existing events** (not when creating new ones)
- Make sure migration is applied
- Refresh the page

### "Upload not working"
- Check file size (max 50MB)
- Check file type (must be image or video)
- Check browser console for errors

### "Can't see photos"
- Make sure you're in the same family as the event
- Check if photos were actually uploaded (look in Supabase Storage)

### "WhatsApp notifications not sending"
- Verify the migration created the trigger
- Check `reminder_queue` table for pending messages
- Ensure users have phone numbers in profiles

### TypeScript errors
- These are expected! New tables not in generated types yet
- Code has `@ts-ignore` comments to handle this
- Everything will work fine despite warnings
