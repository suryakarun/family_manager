## 🤖 AI Travel Feature (Optional)

If you want the AI Travel Planning feature to actually work:

### Get API Keys:
1. **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign up (free $5 credit)
   - Create API key
   - Cost: ~$0.01-0.03 per invitation
   
2. **Weather API**: https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx
   - Sign up (free tier)
   - Copy API key
   - Free: 1M calls/month

### Add to Supabase:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/boopfwfmuulofecarecx
2. Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables
3. Add these secrets:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxx
   WEATHER_API_KEY=xxxxx
   ```

### Deploy Function:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy ai-travel-planner --project-ref boopfwfmuulofecarecx

## 💡 Quick Answers

### "Do I need AI Travel feature?"
**No**, it's optional. Your app works fine without it. Only set it up if you want the travel planning feature.

### "Do I need WhatsApp Reactions?"
**No**, that's documented for future implementation. Not built yet.

### "When should I rebuild the APK?"
**After** you finish testing in localhost and you're happy with everything.

### "What about WhatsApp reminders to all users?"
Review `WHATSAPP_SETUP_GUIDE.md`. It's a Twilio sandbox limitation. Three options:
1. Have users join sandbox (free)
2. Upgrade to Twilio WhatsApp Business API ($$$)
3. Switch to regular SMS (simpler)

### "Are there any bugs?"
No known bugs! All TypeScript errors fixed, build tested, everything documented.

## 🆘 If Something Breaks

### Build Errors:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run build
```

### Android Sync Issues:
```bash
npx cap sync android --force
```

### Session Still Not Working:
- Check `@capacitor/preferences` is installed: `npm list @capacitor/preferences`
- Rebuild APK after changes
