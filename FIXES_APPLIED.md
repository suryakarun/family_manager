# Fixes Applied - October 19, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed

### 1. Session Persistence (Auto-Logout Fix)
**Issue:** User had to login every time the app was opened.

**Solution:**
- Installed `@capacitor/preferences` package
- Updated `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` with Capacitor storage adapter
- Session now persists in native Android storage instead of browser localStorage

**Files Changed:**
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- `package.json`

---

### 2. Localhost Invite Link Fix
**Issue:** Family invite links showed `localhost` instead of production domain.

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/pages/dashboard.tsx` to use `VITE_APP_URL` environment variable
- Created `ENV_SETUP.md` with configuration instructions

**Action Required:**
Add to your `.env` file:
```
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/dashboard.tsx`
- `ENV_SETUP.md` (new)

---

### 3. UI/UX Collisions on Mobile
**Issue:** Calendar elements were overlapping and text was too large on mobile.

**Solution:**
- Added responsive CSS to `src/components/familycalendar.css`
- Smaller font sizes for mobile (< 640px)
- Fixed event title overflow with ellipsis
- Reduced button padding on small screens
- Added flex min-width fixes to prevent overflow

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/familycalendar.css`

## üîÑ To Do

### 4. WhatsApp Reminder Recipients
**Issue:** Reminders only go to Twilio sandbox number, not actual users.

**Root Cause:**
- Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox is for testing only
- Production requires:
  1. Verified Twilio WhatsApp Business Account
  2. Approved message templates
  3. Verified sender phone number

**Quick Fix Options:**
a) **For Testing:** Ensure users join Twilio sandbox (`join <code>` to +14155238886)
b) **For Production:** Upgrade to Twilio WhatsApp Business API (costs apply)

**Files to Check:**
- `supabase/functions/send-whatsapp-reminder/index.ts`
- Verify `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in Supabase secrets

---

### 5. AI Travel Planning Feature
**Feature Request:** Parse invitation images, check calendar conflicts, suggest optimal travel dates with weather forecast.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create new Edge Function: `supabase/functions/ai-travel-planner/`
2. Use OpenAI Vision API to parse invitation image
3. Integrate weather API (OpenWeatherMap or similar)
4. Analyze family calendar events
5. Generate smart suggestions
6. Send WhatsApp message with recommendations

**Required APIs:**
- OpenAI API (for image parsing)
- Weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.)
- Google Maps API (optional, for travel time estimates)

**Estimated Complexity:** High (2-3 days of development)
