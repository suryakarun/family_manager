# Troubleshooting - WhatsApp Not Received

## What We Know:
✅ Function executed successfully
✅ Twilio accepted the message (SID: SM78b21b1489606a774c4cf6b9ef7d4f19)
❌ You didn't receive the WhatsApp

## Most Common Issues:

### 1. WhatsApp Sandbox Not Properly Joined
Even though you joined earlier, sometimes it expires or needs rejoining.

**FIX:**
1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Send this message to: **+1 415 523 8886**
   ```
   join growth-selection
   ```
3. Wait for confirmation from Twilio
4. Then test again

### 2. Wrong Phone Number Format
The message was sent to: +918884509081
Is this YOUR correct WhatsApp number?

### 3. Message in a Different Chat
Check if you have a chat with: **+1 415 523 8886**
The message might be there but not showing as notification

### 4. Twilio Message Pending/Failed
Let's check the Twilio console

## QUICK CHECKS:

### Check 1: Verify Message Status in Twilio
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/sms
2. Look for message with SID: SM78b21b1489606a774c4cf6b9ef7d4f19
3. Check its status:
   - "delivered" = Good! Check your phone
   - "sent" = In transit, wait a minute
   - "failed" = See error message
   - "undelivered" = Not joined to sandbox

### Check 2: Your WhatsApp Number
Run this SQL to verify:
```sql
SELECT id, full_name, phone FROM profiles 
WHERE id = 'dcdd04ee-9806-4dcd-89bb-92fb77cc5074';
```

Is the phone number correct? Should it be:
- +918884509081 (what we're using)
- Or something else?

### Check 3: Re-join Sandbox
In WhatsApp, send to +1 415 523 8886:
```
join growth-selection
```
